I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br>
Are you - Nobody - Too? <br>
Then there's a pair of us! <br>
Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know! <br>
I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br>

<p>
How dreary - to be - Somebody! <br>
How public - like a Frog - <br>
To tell one's name - the livelong June - <br>
To an admiring Bog! <br>
